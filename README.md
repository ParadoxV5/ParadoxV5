#	Px5Ico

Updated May 2022, this repository hosts the
[ERB](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/)
[scripted template](Px5Ico.svg.erb)
and a
[driver script](Px5Ico.rb)
for generating my icon.

It includes the
[animated SVG generated](Px5Ico.svg)
and also a manually exported
[static PNG](Px5Ico.png)
of the animation’s final state.

As with an animated PNG (APNG) export…
The only “screen recorder” with alpha export available,
[timesnap](https://github.com/tungs/timesnap)
, supports only JavaScript-based animation and thus not SVG.
